The project in this project are those of the introduction to the singly linked list

We start with a basic program to print contents inside a node struct

THe next one calculates the size of the linked list and return its size

Then we learned on how to put something to the beginning of the linked list

We append something to the edn of the linked list and then finally frree the memory that we might have allocated in the process

The structures are written entirely in C.
